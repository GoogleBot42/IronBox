Add support for lua 5.2 and 5.3  These versions will be normal and do not require the special c library.  I mostly want to add this just so it can be used on any version of lua.

Add the ability to have nested IronBoxes.  (Not that it is particularly useful but it makes for a lot more fun and a bit more c code.)
